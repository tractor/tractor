\usage{
imageFiles(paths = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{Optionally, a character vector of image paths with or without
suitable suffixes.}
}
\value{
If \code{paths} is \code{NULL}, a singleton reference object of
  class \code{ImageFileSet} which can be used to identify and manipulate
  image files anywhere on the file system. If \code{paths} is specified, an
  S3 object of class \code{fileSetHandle}, a list of functions which can be
  used to manipulate the actual files at those paths. The functions are
  \describe{
    \item{stems()}{Return the file stems associated with the paths.}
    \item{info()}{Return information about existing files, as a list with
      one element per path. An element will be \code{NULL} if no
      corresponding files currently exist.}
    \item{copy(target, overwrite=TRUE)}{Copy the files to target paths (new
      file names or a directory).}
    \item{delete()}{Delete the files or any map reference to them.}
    \item{map(target, overwrite=TRUE, relative=TRUE)}{Map the files to a new
      location (see \code{\link{FileMap}} for details).}
    \item{move(target, overwrite=TRUE)}{Move the files to target paths (new
      file names or a directory).}
    \item{present()}{Return Boolean values indicating whether or not
      files exist at each path.}
    \item{symlink(target, overwrite=TRUE, relative=TRUE)}{Symlink the files
      to target paths (if supported by the OS and file system).}
  }

\description{
TractoR supports several medical imaging file formats, some of which are
made up of multiple files on disk or have compressed and uncompressed
variants. There is also support for auxiliary "sidecar" files, which have
the same path stem as the associated image files but different suffixes, and
contain additional metadata. Typically the image files are in a binary
format for space-efficiency, while any auxiliary files are in text-based
formats for easier human readability. This interface, and the unpinning
reference classes, handle and abstract away this complexity.

\details{
The \code{imageFiles} function returns either a preinitialised instance of
the \code{\link{ImageFileSet}} class, which handles file set logic in the
abstract, or (if given a vector of paths as an argument) calls that
instance's \code{atPaths} method, which facilitates handling specific files.
If non-default parameters to the class constructor are required then a
custom \code{ImageFileSet} object can be created directly instead.

path <- system.file("extdata", "analyze", "maskedb0.img.gz",

Using \code{\link{ImageFileSet}} provides a lower-level and more
  flexible interface; \code{\link{readImageFile}} can be used if you just
  want to read an image into memory.
