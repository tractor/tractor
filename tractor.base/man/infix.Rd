\description{
This is a very simple infix function for the common TractoR idiom whereby
\code{NULL} is used as a default argument value, but later needs to be
resolved to a meaningful value if not overridden in the call. It returns its
first argument unless it is \code{NULL}, in which case it falls back on the
second argument.

\code{\link{where}}, which resolves a value if an expression is
  \code{TRUE}. Several calls to that function can be conveniently chained
  together with this one.
