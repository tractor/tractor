\title{Match regions to a parcellation}
\usage{
matchRegions(regions, parcellation, labels = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{Region names and/or integer indices. Each value is matched at
only one level, but regions are included in the return value if they match
on any term.}

\item{parcellation}{A list object representing a parcellation, as produced
by \verb{[readParcellation()]}.}

\item{labels}{Boolean value. If \code{TRUE}, the labels of the matching regions
are returned; otherwise the integer indices.}
}
\value{
Values corresponding to the matching regions: labels or indices,
depending on the value of \code{labels}.
}
\description{
This function matches region names or indices to values within a
parcellation. Integer-valued region specifications (including number
strings) are matched against region indices; other names are matched to
regions by label, lobe, tissue type and hemisphere in that order of
preference.
