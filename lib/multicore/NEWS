 NEWS/ChangeLog for multicore
------------------------------

0.1-3	2009-02-02
    o	simplify the internal management of child processes and
	consequently remove bugs that lead to poor feeding of cores
	in mclapply() when no precheduling was used


0.1-2	2009-01-09
    o	added mc.preschedule parameter to mclappy() which (if FALSE)
	allows on-demand distribution of FUN calls across cores.

    o	added "silent" parmeter to parallel() and mclapply()
	suppressing output on stdout in child processes

    o	added internal functions closeStdout(), closeStrerr(),
	closeFD(), closeAll(), isChild(), childrenDescriptors() and
	masterDescriptor()

    o	selectChildren() implicitly checks for and removes zombies

    o	removed spurious debugging output in mclapply()

    o	fixed cases in which mclapply() would not preserve names

    o	fixed child list management

    o	in order to make sure that children cannot die before the
	master can collect results, children will specifically wait
	for the master to allow them to exit (SIGUSR1 is used for this
	purpose, so don't use it directly unless you want a child to
	exit even if the master didn't release it).


0.1-1	2009-01-03
    o	added name parameter to parallel(), accordingly collect()
	names the results if the job name is present

    o	bug fix: collect() returned early if no jobs responded for a
	while

    o	bug fix: internal list of children could get corrupted when a
	child was removed (all preceding children were removed as well)

    o	added better debugging support. Set PKG_CFLAGS=-DMC_DEBUG to
	enable debugging output on stdout (it is purposefully not sent
	to the R console to prevent output processing issues in child
	processes)


0.1-0	2009-01-02
    o	initial release
